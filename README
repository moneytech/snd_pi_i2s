Raspberry PI PCM I2S driver
===========================

This repository contains a very poor quality I2S PCM ALSA driver
for Raspberry Pi.
It will output 16 bits per sample, 44100Hz stereo I2S to use with a
DAC similar to the TDA1541A. If you require different format or frequency
then feel free to modify this driver to suit, but I can't guarantee support.


It is a work in progress which I hope to continue in time.
The first version uses an IRQ to keep the PCM FIFO full.
However, there are glitches in the audio due to the sheer mass of interrupts.
I hope to improve that with time by using DMA.
